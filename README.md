# MovieReviewAnalysis
Predicts the sentiment of a movie review

**INTRODUCTION**

In today's fast-paced digital age, content is king. From social media posts to product reviews, the internet is flooded with a never-ending stream of information. However, not all content is created equal. Some content can have a positive impact on people's lives, while others can be harmful or misleading. It is important to be able to distinguish between these different types of content, which is where sentiment analysis comes in. Sentiment analysis is the process of using natural language processing and machine learning techniques to identify the underlying sentiment of a piece of text, whether it be positive, negative, or neutral. In this project, we will delve into the world of sentiment analysis and explore how it can be used to gain insights into the opinions, emotions, and attitudes of people towards a particular topic. We will explore various approaches to sentiment analysis, such as lexicon-based, machine learning-based, and deep learning-based techniques. Join us on this journey as we uncover the power of sentiment analysis in today's digital landscape.

**DATASET**

The data was collected by the process of gathering and measuring information on targeted variables of interest in an organized system, which allowed for answering relevant questions and deciding future outcomes. The data was ensured to be relevant and validated. The source site chosen was Kaggle as it provides quality and valid data."

**MODELS IMPLEMENTED**

As a part of our project, we implemented three different classification models to analyze our data. The models we used were Random Forest, KNN Classifier, and Decision Tree. These models were chosen due to their ability to handle complex data sets, provide accurate predictions, and the ease of implementation. We compared the results of each model to determine the most effective approach for our data analysis.

**MODEL DEPLOYMENT**

As a part of our project, we deployed a sentiment analysis model in Flask, a popular web framework for Python. To save our trained model, we used a pickle file, which allowed us to easily load and reuse the model for future predictions. In the Flask app, we loaded the trained model from the pickle file and integrated it with a user-friendly web interface. This allowed users to input text data and receive real-time sentiment analysis results based on the model's predictions. By deploying our model in Flask using a pickle file, we were able to create an efficient, scalable solution for sentiment analysis that could be easily adapted for real-world applications.

**PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION**

Download and store all the code files in the same folder.
 - execute app.py in the cmd (>python app.py)
 - copy paste the web url in browser
 - paste the context that need to be analyzed in the given text box and click on "Predict"
 - Sentiment type is generated
